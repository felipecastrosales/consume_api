<h1 align="center">Consuming API</h1>

---

<h2 align="center">About 📖</h2>

<p align="center">
    This was a small test using API consumption with Flutter.<br>
    Here I studied about consumption using the following packages: http, getConnect and dio. With that, I was able to study and note the particularities of each one, how to implement and access with each one.<br>
</p>

<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯</h2>

<p align="center">
    This was a very interesting study on API Consumption, and it clarified a lot of my ideas and knowledge that I already had about this topic. It was very fruitful and I got a lot of knowledge.
